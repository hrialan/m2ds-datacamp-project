### Project description :
The idea of the project is to use __Machine Learning__ algorithms to predict the __price__ of an __Airbnb__ rental in Paris.

Such an algorithm could be very useful for rental sites, Here are the potentials use cases :
- Predict the price of an apartment rental based on its characteristics to advise owners. This can help owners choose a price that is neither too high nor too low for their property. 
- Scams are very present on rental sites. For example, fake accommodations at attractive prices allow scammers to steal identity papers. It could be interesting to detect such fraudulent ads in order to warn customers and to prevent them.
